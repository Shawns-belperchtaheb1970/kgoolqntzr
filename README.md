Wow. Just walked out. Brain still feels like it’s doing somersaults. I swear the smell of popcorn is embedded in my clothes now. The Legend of Ochi — absolutely wild. It’s like if you mixed a kaleidoscope with a blender and then made it a movie. I kept thinking about the way she looked at Ochi, like she knew him from a dream or something. 

The theater was so noisy, people wwas practically swimming through sound waves just to hear the whispers of leaves and beasts on screen. That scene. Ochi doing… was it singing? Or the forest just breathing in rhythm? God, I’m still tasting the stale popcorn crumbs. Seriously, find pieces in belly button later probably.

Anyway wow, remember that part where he was flying or more like floating — hovering almost like me on a unicycle on a tightrope, the tension just there. I kept expecting him to just fall into a sea of metaphors and goulash. You remember goulash? That’s what my grandmother used to serve with tales of her own legends. 

> I couldn’t help but think that the forest in Ochi’s world feels like my mind right now after the trapeze: upside down and spinning, yet strangely centered. 

The crowd was a beast of its own too. I swear sitting in that seat made my back ache like that time I tried the triple backflip without practice. Painful but oddly satisfying, you know? A reminder that I’m alive.

Someone told me to download the movie, like wow, as if the experience could be squished into a file. You gotta watch the movie, feel the sheer chaos of it all. 

I think I saw someone with a parrot in the theater. Or was it just leftover hallucination from the movie? Everything’s blurred like cotton candy in the rain. Absurd, right? But is it really more absurd than a shapeshifting… what was it, a swan? I don’t know anymore. 

Watch it if you want. Or don’t. But maybe do. I still see Ochi when I close my eyes, which is weird in a way that's kinda nice and unsettling. 

Why would the sun be shining inside the theater? Like my eyes must’ve been playing tricks. The tricks of the screen are no different than the circus. Or maybe more like a juggler who tells stories with knives? 

god what // is happening var legend = Ochi; while (brain.hasThoughts()) { processLegend(legend); }
